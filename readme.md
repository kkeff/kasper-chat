Information

The bots will chat after 17.5 sec if no one has spoken in that time.

A random bot will change status after 20 sec if no one has changed status in
that time.

If a bot goes from offline to online/in game another bot will send a greeting
message (if there are still bots online). A message will also be sent to the
main user when the app starts.

It is possible to change status of the bots if you click on their avatar
(friend container).

The bots will respond if you write their name, if they are online/in game.

The bots where inspired by 2001 - A space odyssey.
